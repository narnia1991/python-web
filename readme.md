# Simple web app to test out flask

It has been fun studying this

I code along [Tech with Tim's](https://www.youtube.com/@TechWithTim) [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dam0GPOAvVI) for the website, but this is somewhat outdated so I made it using the updated Flask version

I then uploaded it into an EC2 instance following [Vincent Steventson's](https://www.youtube.com/@VincentStevenson) [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5XiVh6v4uI)

[Try it out here](http://13.211.130.152/login)

### Possible enhancements:

- Harden the EC2 instance.
- Use a custom domain
- Use another database other than sqlite
- Have edit notes mode
- Have email link signup and forget password
